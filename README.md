## Sum of Numbers up to a Given Number

### Problem Description:

Given a positive integer n, write a Java program to calculate the sum of all positive integers from 1 to n, inclusive.

Function Signature:

```java
public int calculateSum(int n)
```
### Input:

An integer n where 1 <= n <= 10^4.

### Output:

An integer representing the sum of all positive integers from 1 to n.

## Factorial of a Number

### Problem Description:

Write a Java program that computes the factorial of a positive integer entered by the user. Display the result.

Function Signature:

```java
public int calculateFactorial(int n)
```
### Input:

An integer n where n >= 0.

### Output:

An integer representing the factorial of n.
Prime Number Check

### Problem Description:


## Develop a Java program that checks whether a given positive integer is a prime number or not. Display an appropriate message.

Function Signature:

```java
public boolean isPrime(int n)
```
### Input:

An integer n where n >= 2.

### Output:

A boolean value indicating whether n is prime or not (true for prime, false for non-prime).

## Generating Fibonacci Sequence

### Problem Description:

Write a Java program to generate the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence and display them.

Function Signature:

```java
public int[] generateFibonacci(int n)
```
### Input:

An integer n where n >= 1.

### Output:

An array of integers representing the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence.

## Drawing Shapes with Stars

### Problem Description:

Create a Java program that draws a pattern of asterisk (*) characters based on user input for the number of rows and columns.

Function Signature:

```java
public void drawPattern(int rows, int columns)
```
### Input:

Two integers, rows and columns, where rows and columns are both greater than or equal to 1.

### Output:

Display a pattern of asterisk (*) characters with the specified number of rows and columns.

## Find the Largest and Smallest Number

### Problem Description:

Write a Java program that finds the largest and smallest numbers from a list of integers entered by the user. Display both results.

Function Signature:

```java
public void findMinMax(int[] numbers)
```
### Input:

An array of integers, numbers, where the length of the array is at least 1.

### Output:

Display the largest and smallest numbers from the given list.

## FizzBuzz

### Problem Description:

Write a Java program that prints the numbers from 1 to n. But for multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of 5, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

Function Signature:

```java
public void fizzBuzz(int n)
```

### Input
An integer n where n >= 1.

### Output:
Print the numbers from 1 to n based on the FizzBuzz rules.
